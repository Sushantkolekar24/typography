The unit-linked, individual pension plan can be later converted into regular income by the purchase of an annuity plan on completion of the term. The plan,<span class="bg-light m-1"  >which was launched on September 5</span>  can be purchased offline through agents and brokers, or one can also download the form from LIC's official website. LIC has termed the policy as a non-participating, unit-linked, individual pension plan, which is meant for long-term regular savings.

    Investors can opt for the desired amount of premium and the policy term depending upon the minimum and maximum limits of premium, policy term, and vesting age.  </div>
